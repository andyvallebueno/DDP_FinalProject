# DDP_FinalProject

This repo is related to the Final Project for the Coursera Developing Data Products class. This assignment focuses on state-level data from the United States related to GDP per capita, population, illiteracy and other variables. A Shiny App has been developed which enables the user to select a variable to relate to GDP per capita and build a linear model and graphs relating the two variables. 

The repo includes the ui.R and server.R files in which the Shiny App is built, and a pitch presentation to pitch the app.
